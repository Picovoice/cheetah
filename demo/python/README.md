## Installation

```console
pip3 install pvcheetahdemo
```

## AccessKey

AccessKey is your authentication and authorization token for deploying Picovoice SDKs, including Cheetah. Anyone who is
using Picovoice needs to have a valid AccessKey. You must keep your AccessKey secret. You would need internet
connectivity to validate your AccessKey with Picovoice license servers even though the voice recognition is running 100%
offline.

AccessKey also verifies that your usage is within the limits of your account. Everyone who signs up for
[Picovoice Console](https://console.picovoice.ai/) receives the `Free Tier` usage rights described
[here](https://picovoice.ai/pricing/). If you wish to increase your limits, you can purchase a subscription plan.

## Usage

### Microphone Demo

You need a working microphone connected to your machine for this demo. Run the following in the terminal:

```console
cheetah_demo_mic --access_key ${ACCESS_KEY}
```

Replace `${ACCESS_KEY}` with yours obtained from Picovoice Console.

### File Demo

Run the following in the terminal:

```console
cheetah_demo_file --access_key ${ACCESS_KEY} --wav_paths ${WAV_PATH}
```

Replace `${ACCESS_KEY}` with yours obtained from Picovoice Console and `${WAV_PATH}` with a path to a compatible
(single-channel, 16 kHz, 16-bit PCM) wav file you wish to transcribe.
