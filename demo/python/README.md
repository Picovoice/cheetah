## Installation

pip3 install pvleoparddemo
```

## AccessKey

AccessKey is your authentication and authorization token for deploying Picovoice SDKs, including Leopard. Anyone who is
using Picovoice needs to have a valid AccessKey. You must keep your AccessKey secret. You would need internet
connectivity to validate your AccessKey with Picovoice license servers even though the voice recognition is running 100%
offline.

AccessKey also verifies that your usage is within the limits of your account. Everyone who signs up for
[Picovoice Console](https://console.picovoice.ai/) receives the `Free Tier` usage rights described
[here](https://picovoice.ai/pricing/). If you wish to increase your limits, you can purchase a subscription plan.

## Usage

### File Demo

Run the following in the terminal:

```console
leopard_demo_file --access_key ${ACCESS_KEY} --audio_paths ${AUIDO_PATH}
```

Replace `${ACCESS_KEY}` with yours obtained from Picovoice Console and `${AUDIO_PATH}` with a path to an audio file you
wish to transcribe.

### Microphone Demo

You need a working microphone connected to your machine for this demo. Run the following in the terminal:

```console
leopard_demo_mic --access_key ${ACCESS_KEY}
```

Replace `${ACCESS_KEY}` with yours obtained from Picovoice Console. Once running, the demo prints:

```console
>>> Press `ENTER` to start: 
```

Press `ENTER` key and wait for the following message in the terminal:

```console
>>> Recording ... Press `ENTER` to stop:
```

Now start recording and when done press `ENTER` key to get the transcription.
