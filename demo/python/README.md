## AccessKey

Cheetah requires a valid Picovoice `AccessKey` at initialization. `AccessKey` acts as your credentials when using Cheetah SDKs.
You can get your `AccessKey` for free. Make sure to keep your `AccessKey` secret.
Signup or Login to [Picovoice Console](https://console.picovoice.ai/) to get your `AccessKey`.

## Usage

### Microphone Demo

You need a working microphone connected to your machine for this demo. Run the following in the terminal:

```console
cheetah_demo_mic --access_key ${ACCESS_KEY}
```

Replace `${ACCESS_KEY}` with yours obtained from Picovoice Console.

### File Demo

Run the following in the terminal:

```console
cheetah_demo_file --access_key ${ACCESS_KEY} --wav_paths ${WAV_PATH}
```

Replace `${ACCESS_KEY}` with yours obtained from Picovoice Console and `${WAV_PATH}` with a path to a compatible
(single-channel, 16 kHz, 16-bit PCM) wav file you wish to transcribe.
