/**
 * Forward declaration for Cheetah speech-to-text engine. It transcribes speech within an incoming stream of audio in
 * real-time. Cheetah processes incoming audio in consecutive frames and for each frame emits partial transcription
 * results as they become available. The number of samples per frame can be attained by calling
 * `pv_cheetah_frame_length()`. The incoming audio needs to have a sample rate equal to `pv_sample_rate()` and be 16-bit
 * linearly-encoded. Cheetah operates on single-channel audio.

 * Constructor.

 * @param access_key AccessKey obtained from Picovoice Console (https://picovoice.ai/console/)

 * of audio (with a duration specified herein) after an utterance without any speech in it. Set to `0` to disable
 * endpoint detection.
 * @param enable_automatic_punctuation Set to `true` to enable automatic punctuation insertion.
 * @param[out] object Constructed instance of Cheetah.
 * @return Status code. Returns `PV_STATUS_INVALID_ARGUMENT`, `PV_STATUS_IO_ERROR`, `PV_STATUS_OUT_OF_MEMORY`,
 * `PV_STATUS_RUNTIME_ERROR`, `PV_STATUS_ACTIVATION_ERROR`, `PV_STATUS_ACTIVATION_LIMIT_REACHED`,
