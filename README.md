## AccessKey

AccessKey is your authentication and authorization token for deploying Picovoice SDKs, including Cheetah. Anyone who is
using Picovoice needs to have a valid AccessKey. You must keep your AccessKey secret. You would need internet
connectivity to validate your AccessKey with Picovoice license servers even though the voice recognition is running 100%
offline.

AccessKey also verifies that your usage is within the limits of your account. Everyone who signs up for
[Picovoice Console](https://console.picovoice.ai/) receives the `Free Tier` usage rights described
[here](https://picovoice.ai/pricing/). If you wish to increase your limits, you can purchase a subscription plan.

## Demos

### Python Demos

First, make sure you have Python 3 installed along with the necessary packages included in the requirements.txt file:

```bash
python --version
Python 3.6.8

pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

#### File-Based Demo

The demo transcribes a set of audio files provided as command line arguments. The demo has been tested using Python 3.6.
Note that the files need to be single-channel, 16KHz, and 16-bit linearly-encoded. For more information about audio
requirements refer to [pv_cheetah.h](/include/pv_cheetah.h). The following transcribes the WAV file located in the
resource directory.

```bash
python demo/python/cheetah_demo_file.py --audio_paths resources/audio_samples/test.wav --license_path ${PATH_TO_YOUR_CHEETAH_LICENSE_FILE}
```

In order to transcribe multiple files concatenate their paths using comma as below.

```bash
python demo/python/cheetah_demo_file.py --audio_paths ${PATH_TO_AUDIO_FILE_1},${PATH_TO_AUDIO_FILE_2},${PATH_TO_AUDIO_FILE_3} --license_path ${PATH_TO_YOUR_CHEETAH_LICENSE_FILE}
```

### Realtime Demo

This Cheetah demo records audio from the microphone and transcribes it in real-time:

```bash
python demo/python/cheetah_demo_mic.py --license_path ${PATH_TO_YOUR_CHEETAH_LICENSE_FILE}
```

Note: you need to have a working microphone and it needs to be set as the default audio capture device on your computer
for the demo to function correctly.

### C Demos

#### File-Based Demo

This demo application accepts a set of WAV files as input and returns their transcripts. Note that the demo expects the
audio files to be WAV, 16KHz, and 16-bit linearly-encoded. It does not perform any verification to assure the
compatibility or correctness of the input audio files. Set the current working directory to the root of the repository.

The demo can be built using `gcc` as below.

```bash
gcc -I include/ -O3 demo/c/cheetah_demo.c -ldl -o cheetah_demo
```

The usage can be attained by:

```bash
./cheetah_demo
```

Then it can be used as follows:

```bash
./cheetah_demo \
./lib/linux/x86_64/libpv_cheetah.so \
./lib/common/acoustic_model.pv \
./lib/common/language_model.pv \
${PATH_TO_YOUR_CHEETAH_LICENSE_FILE} \
./resources/audio_samples/test.wav
```

In order to transcribe multiple files, append the absolute path to each additional file to the list of command line
arguments as follows:

```bash
./cheetah_demo \
./lib/linux/x86_64/libpv_cheetah.so \
./lib/common/acoustic_model.pv \
./lib/common/language_model.pv \
${PATH_TO_YOUR_CHEETAH_LICENSE_FILE} \
${PATH_TO_AUDIO_FILE_1} ${PATH_TO_AUDIO_FILE_2} ${PATH_TO_AUDIO_FILE_3}
```

#### Realtime Demo

This demo records the input audio from a microphone and transcribes in real-time. Running the command from root of the
repository, the demo can be built using `gcc`:

```bash
gcc -I include/ -O3 demo/c/cheetah_demo_realtime.c -ldl -lasound -o cheetah_demo_realtime
```

The usage can be attained by

```bash
./cheetah_demo_realtime
```

It can be used as follows

```bash
./cheetah_demo_realtime \
lib/linux/x86_64/libpv_cheetah.so \
AUDIO_DEVICE_NAME \
lib/common/acoustic_model.pv \
lib/common/language_model.pv \
${PATH_TO_YOUR_CHEETAH_LICENSE_FILE}
```

The `AUDIO_DEVICE_NAME` parameter for the microphone can be found using

```bash
arecord -L
```

Note: you need to have a working microphone.

## SDKs

### Python

[cheetah.py](/binding/python/cheetah.py) provides a Python binding for Cheetah library. Below is a quick demonstration
of how to construct an instance of it.

```python
library_path = ...  # The file is available under lib/linux/x86_64/libpv_cheetah.so
acoustic_model_path = ...  # The file is available under lib/common/acoustic_model.pv
language_model_path = ...  # The file is available under lib/common/language_model.pv
license_path = ...  # The .lic file is available from Picovoice Console (https://picovoice.ai/console/)

handle = Cheetah(library_path, acoustic_model_path, language_model_path, license_path)
```

When initialized, valid sample rate can be obtained using `handle.sample_rate`. Expected frame length (number of audio
samples in each input array) is `handle.frame_length`.

```python
audio = ...  # audio data to be transcribed

num_frames = len(audio) / handle.frame_length

transcript = ''

for i in range(num_frames):
    frame = [i * handle.frame_length:(i + 1) * handle.frame_length]
    partial_transcript, _ = handle.process(frame)
    transcript += partial_transcript

transcript += handle.flush()
```

When finished, release the acquired resources.

```python
handle.delete()
```

### C

Cheetah is implemented in ANSI C and therefore can be directly linked to C applications.
[pv_cheetah.h](/include/pv_cheetah.h) header file contains relevant information. An instance of the Cheetah object can
be constructed as follows:

```c
const char *acoustic_model_path = ... // The file is available under lib/common/acoustic_model.pv
const char *language_model_path = ... // The file is available under lib/common/language_model.pv
const char *license_path = ... // The .lic file is available from Picovoice Console (https://picovoice.ai/console/)
const int32_t endpoint_duration_sec = ... // endpoint duration in seconds. set to '-1' to disable endpointing

pv_cheetah_t *handle;
const pv_status_t status = pv_cheetah_init(
    acoustic_model_path,
    language_model_path,
    license_path,
    endpoint_duration_sec,
    &handle);
if (status != PV_STATUS_SUCCESS) {
    // error handling logic
}
```

Now the `handle` can be used to process incoming audio stream. Cheetah accepts single-channel 16-bit PCM audio. The
sample rate can be retrieved using `pv_sample_rate()`. Finally, Cheetah accepts input audio in consecutive chunks
(aka frames); the length of each frame can be retrieved using `pv_cheetah_frame_length()`.

```C
const int16_t *audio = ... // audio data to be transcribed
const int audio_length = ... // number of samples in audio

const int num_frames = audio_length / pv_cheetah_frame_length();

char *transcript = ... // buffer for storing transcription.

for (int i = 0; i < num_frames; i++) {
    const int16_t *frame = &audio[i * pv_cheetah_frame_length()];

    char *partial_transcript;
    bool is_endpoint; // is updated only if endpoint detection is enabled at construction time.
    const pv_status_t status = pv_cheetah_process(handle, frame, &partial_transcript, &is_endpoint);
    if (status != PV_STATUS_SUCCESS) {
        // error handling logic
    }

    strcat(transcript, partial_transcript);
    free(partial_transcript);
}

char *final_transcript;
const pv_status_t status = pv_cheetah_flush(handle, &final_transcript)
if (status != PV_STATUS_SUCCESS) {
    // error handling logic
}

strcat(transcript, final_transcript);
free(final_transcript);
```

Finally, when done be sure to release resources acquired.

```C
pv_cheetah_delete(handle);
```
